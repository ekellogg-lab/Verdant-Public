# Verdant-Public

Verdant is a web-based platform for chloroplast genome annotation, alignment, and phylogenetic analysis deveopled by Michael McKain, Ryan Hatsock, Molly Wohl, and Toby Kellogg.  Verdant, through the novel annotation software annoBTD, annotates chloroplast genomes without user intervention with a high degree of accurracy. The annotated chloroplast genomes are then entered into the Verdant database, where the user can interact with them through creation of "Project".  Visit <a href="http://verdant.iplantcollaborative.org/plastidDB/">Verdant</a> to explore the software.

This repository is a staging ground for the development of new features in Verdant. We will provide early access here so that users can help us guide the development of new software for implementation.
